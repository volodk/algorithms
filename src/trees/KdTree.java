 * In computer science, a k-d tree (short for k-dimensional tree) is a
 * space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional
 * space. k-d trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such
 * as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and
 * nearest neighbor searches). k-d trees are a special case of binary space
 * partitioning trees.

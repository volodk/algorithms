/**
 * In computer science, the treap and the randomized binary search tree are two
 * closely related forms of binary search tree data structures that maintain a
 * dynamic set of ordered keys and allow binary searches among the keys. After
 * any sequence of insertions and deletions of keys, the shape of the tree is a
 * random variable with the same probability distribution as a random binary
 * tree; in particular, with high probability its height is proportional to the
 * logarithm of the number of keys, so that each search, insertion, or deletion
 * operation takes logarithmic time to perform.
 *

/**
 * Blelloch and Reid-Miller[4] describe an application of treaps to a problem of
 * maintaining sets of items and performing set union, set intersection, and set
 * difference operations, using a treap to represent each set.
